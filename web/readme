        ^^ before these were all transitional functions,
        taking us to the next release. They were intentionally
        distinct during the design to make accidents hard.

        However in a thumbed touch screen interface mistakes
        are going to be common.

 So Probably something like this

 +      + +      +
     <        >      Current track selection interface
 +      + +      +
 P | 3 | 4 | 5 | S   Ranking as before, these now set toggle
 [  Next Release ]   
  Normally this is disabled unless one of the above "toggles"
  is actuated.
 
 Also instead of stopping, like the normal interface, this will
 cycle around the album until a decision is made.
